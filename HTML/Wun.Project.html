				<h2>Slice-A-Mole</h2>
				<p>Dublin High School Computer Science Education</p>
				<p>12/21/15 - 1/8/16</p>
				<p>My objective for this project was to create a game like Whack
				-A-Mole for carrier devices.My team decided to make it have the 
				feeling of playing the game Fuit Ninja on the game Whack-A-Mole.
				This would lead to our title Slice-A-Mole. This game was suppose
				to be made for children. There were many challenges for this 
				game. It was difficult to minimizes the amount of code, while 
				doing the commands that we needed. Our teamwork for this game 
				was good, becuase my partner was one of my friends.

				<h2>Text-Adventure</h2>
				<p>Dublin High School Computer Science Education</p>
				<p>03/11/2016 - 02/29/2016</p>
				<p>
					Text Adventure was a Python coded game. We made our project 
					based around a personality quiz.
					The quiz asks the the user and their choice to complete an 
					action. Through this project, I learned to use branching and
					making it more effiecent.

				<h2>Hangman Project</h2>
				<p>Dublin High School Computer Science Education</p>
				<p>03/25/2016 - 03/21/2016</p>
				<p>
					The Hangman project was coded in Python. The goals for the 
					project was to allow the user to guess letters until the 
					work or phrase was correct. The project references the game,
					Super Smash Bros. .
					The program list consists of all the character of the game 
					and it is randomily selected to let the user guess the 
					character. During the project, I learned to use while and
					for loops properly and how they can funciton as a whole.

				<h2>Suzzie The Sushi Chief Who Isn't A Sushi Chief That Sells 
				Sushi ChatBot</h2>
				<p>Dublin High School AP Computer Science</p>
				<p>10/5/16 - 12/5/16</p>
				<p>
					The Suzie chatbot was made in my AP Computer Science class. 
					The goals of this project was to create a chatbot that
					communicates with a few friendly question and guide you the 
					user to how to make the food they want to make. If the user 
					were to change the type of food they want to make, they 
					would have to start over. During the project, I learned that
					it in java, extending classes work like a food pyramid.

				<h2>Politika Proto.io</h2>
				<p>Dublin High School AP Computer Science</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					Politika was a project made in Proto.io. My fellow
					classmates and I knew that the presidential election of 2017
					had just ended. We realized that that many of the voters 
					were not completely voting. We thought that either they were
					uninformed around the people or the bills they were voting
					for. The Politika app was to designed to allow the fellow 
					community to understand what is happening in our government.
					The app allows us to see The process and the name of the 
					bill and allow the people to vote if they want to see any 
					updates of this bill.
