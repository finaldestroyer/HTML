My name is Japheth. I am a student at Dublin High School in California. DHS has offered many of my favorite course that i wanted to take. I am taking one of my favorite classes of all time. I am currently taking Computer Science at my school. In coding, I know the basic to JavaScript and Python. I am proficient with Scratch and HTML. What inspired me to code in computer science is that I loved playing game and in school I loved math. This major fitted perfectly for me. My childhood game that inspired me to code was mainly Pokemon sponsors my Nintendo. Currently my class has done some scratch projects. Check off the Projects page to see some of my work. In the future, I want to become a full on computer engineering and Video Game creator/designer/ programmer.
